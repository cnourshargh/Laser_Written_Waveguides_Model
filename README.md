# Ultrafast Laser Written Waveguides Model

This repository contains code produced and editted by Camron Nourshargh for modelling the refractive index changes induced by laser writing in transparent materials and the optical modes guided by the structures. It was developed as part of his Fourth Year Project during his undergraduate degree in Engineering Science at Oxford University.
